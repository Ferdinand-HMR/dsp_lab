\b read_wavefile_01.m
\b0 \
\
In Matlab, reads 'cat' wav file.\
Play signal, plot signal, illustrate quantization, FFT and plot.\
Illustrates fftshift, FFT zero-padding\
\

\b read_wav_example_02.py\
read_wav_example_03.py\

\b0 \
Open a wav file in python and read information.\
\

\b write_sin_01.py\

\b0 \
How many bits per sample ?\
How many bits per second ?\
What if maxAmp is higher than the value used in the demo ? or lower ?\
For the stereo, how many bits per second are there ?\
What if 'h' is a different code ?\
What if number of channels > 2 ?\
\

\b read_sin_01.m\

\b0 \
Plot the spectrum of the sinusoid. The peak in the spectrum better match the frequency of the sinusoid!\
\

\b write_sin_02.py
\b0 \
\
Use python to generate a wav file with more bits per sample.\
Verify that the spectrum has a peak at the prescribed frequency.\
Verify that that the number of bits per sample is the prescribed value.\
\

\b Activities for students (see assignment)
\b0 \
\
Use Matlab to read in sin_02_mono.wav\
- Verify quantization size, is it as expected?\
\
Use Python to generate a .wav file of a sine wave at 8\
bits per sample. (How do you do this done ?)\
\
Read your 8 bit/sample wav file into matlab\
- verify quantization is as expected, verify spectrum,\
- Is there any audible affect of the lower number of bits/second?\
	\
Use Python to create a wave file of a sinusoid with a lower frequency, like 50 Hz.\
How low can the frequency be before you can not hear it?\
\
Use python to create a wav file with more than two channels.  Read the wave file into Matlab and plot the individual channels.\
	\
In a stereo wave file, how are the two channels of a stereo audio signal stored?  \
\
Use Python to create a wave file of a sinusoid using a higher sampling rate, like 16K 32K or 441,000 samples/second.\
