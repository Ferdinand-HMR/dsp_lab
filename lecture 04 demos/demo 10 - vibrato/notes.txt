Chapter 2 of 'Audio Effects: Theory, Implementation and Application'

Start with basic delay using circular buffer of non-minimum length.

	play_delay_longbuffer.py


Vibrato with no interpolation: 	play_vibrato_simple.py

Vibrato with interpolation: 	play_vibrato_interpolation.py

Warning: Make sure delay is 
  1) CAUSAL
  2) SHORTER THAN BUFFER LENGTH
otherwise output signal will have audible artifacts.

demo cosine (with fixed frequency) into vibrato effect
	-> hear time-varying frequency

To discuss:
  Instantaneous frequency.
