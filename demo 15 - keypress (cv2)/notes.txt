cv2 is a Python library for computer vision based on OpenCV.

cv2 can detect when a key on the keyboard is pressed using the function cv2.waitKey.  To use this function, an image should first be displayed on the screen.  The waitKey function waits for a specified amount of time for a key to be pressed.  waitKey(10) will wait for up to 10 milliseconds. If no key is pressed during that time, then waitKey returns a value of -1.  If a key is pressed, then waitKey returns a corresponding key number.  waitKey(0) will wait forever for a key to be pressed.

Installing cv2: If you are not using anaconda, then try

pip install opencv-python
or
pip3 install opencv-python
or
sudo pip install opencv-python
or
sudo pip3 install opencv-python


Another way to install cv2 is using Anaconda. Conda is a package manager, which allows for easy and quick installation of a lot of python libraries.

To download and install Anaconda:
https://conda.io/docs/download.html
https://conda.io/docs/install/full.html

To install Opencv with Anaconda, run the following command on the terminal:

conda install -c conda-forge opencv=3.2.0

or (if the above does not work)

conda install -c menpo opencv3=3.2.0
