 

Read a WAV file into Python, then filter it and play it to the speaker.

1) In Matlab:

	make_and_use_filter.m

	This program loads a wave file of a speech signal, 
	makes a bandpass filter,
	applies the bandpass filter to the speech signal,
	write the output signal to a wave file (output_matlab.wav),
	plays the wave file

2) In Python:

	filter_play_wav_mono.py

	This program loads the same wave file and applies the same
	filter as in the matlab program make_and_test_filter

Activities:

	Modify the Python program so it writes output to a wave file.
	Then verify that the wave file is the same as the wave file
	produced by matlab (e.g., read both wave files into matlab
	and plot the error between them).

	Modify python program so that it plays a stereo: original signal
	in left channel, output signal in right channel.
