# dsp_lab
This repository contains assignment in the dsp laboratory.

The assignments mainly focus on Real-time implementation of algorithms for digital signal processing (DSP) with an emphasis on audio processing. Audio input-output and buffering. Filtering (recursive and non-recursive filters, structures). Fast Fourier transform and windowed spectral analysis. Digital audio effects (delay line, amplitude modulation, reverberation, distortion, phase vocoder). Time-varying and adaptive filters. Students with learn to implement these algorithms for real-time audio processing  in software.
